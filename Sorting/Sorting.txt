#Sorting#
  - Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection(e.g an array)
    so that the items are in some kind of order

  ## sort()
    - The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array.
      The sort is not necessarily stable. The default sort order is according ti string Unicode points
    - The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function
    - You can use this comparator function to tell Javascript how you want it to sort.
    - The comparator looks at pairs of elements(a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value

  ## Bubble Sort
    - A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top!
