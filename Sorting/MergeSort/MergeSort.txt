FASTER SORTS:
 - There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(nlogn)
 - There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
 - The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand.

  # Merge Sort
   - It's a combination of two things - merging and sorting
   - Exploits the fact that array of 0 or 1 element are always sorted.
   - Works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, 
     then building up a newly sorted array
