Linear Search - A very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one.

Binary search - A much faster form of search
              - You can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a  time
              - It works only on sorted arrays.
              - Divide and conquer
              - It has 0(LogN)
