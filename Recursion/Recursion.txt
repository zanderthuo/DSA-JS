Recursion -  A function that calls itself.

Example of Recursion:
    - JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
    - document.getElementById and DOM traversal
    - Object traversal

The call Stack
  - It's a stack data structure
  - Anytime a function is invoked it is placed (pushed) on the top of the call stack
  - When Javascript sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will remove (pop)

Base Case
  - The condition when the recursion ends.
